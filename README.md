# Application Description
EcoMate is a mobile application that provides information and resources for a sustainable
lifestyle, helping people who want to switch to a more environmentally friendly way of living. The
application offers comprehensive information about sustainable living, including
recommendations and a marketplace for environmentally friendly goods, a carbon footprint
calculator for users, and step-by-step and everyday tips to support users' journey towards living
a sustainable lifestyle. With this application, users can easily access a wealth of information and
resources to help them make more sustainable choices in their daily lives. Through this app, We
try to solve the environmental problems related to 3rd SDG : “Good Health & Well-Being”, 12th
SDG : "Responsible Consumption And Production" and also 13th SDG : “Climate Action”, as the
majority of households still lack an understanding of how to live in a more environmentally
friendly manner. There are 3 features on this application.
1. News and Tips about sustainable lifestyle
2. Marketplace for sustainable consumption
4. Carbon footprint calculator and Air Quality Index (AQI) viewer

# Future improvement
We believe that our application has more potential that can be developed in the future. We have planned these features to be added for the future improvement.
1. A sustainable lifestyle forum
2. Set target profile for sustainable (this affects general app content)
3. Using machine learning to determine carbon footprint activities based on image taken
4. Carbon tax paymen
